Welcome to the sMAP Library!
============================

This documentation exists to document the sMAP python library.  The
sMAP library contains utilities and data structures for creating sMAP
servers which implement the profile as of version 2.  By following
the introduction and tutorial, you'll be able to learn the basics of
creating a new sMAP source which can be integrated into a stream
processing and storage architecture.

For more detailed information and a full specification of the sMAP
profile, see the `documentation <http://cs.berkeley.edu/~stevedh/pubs/v2.pdf>`_.
